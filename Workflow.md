### Importing
1.	The project starts with importing the necessary libraries and the required dataset
![import and view](https://github.com/therealyash/Google-Play-Store-Case-Study/blob/main/Assets/Images/import%20and%20view.png?raw=true)

### Data Cleaning

2.	The following tasks related to data handling were performed 
  - data handling 
  - cleaning junk records
  - adding missing values 
  - changing data types 
  - removing outliers

### Data Analysis

3.	Analyzed the ratings using the histogram, and saw that data was skewed towards the higher ratings.

![distribution of rating 2](https://github.com/therealyash/Google-Play-Store-Case-Study/blob/main/Assets/Images/distribution%20of%20rating%202.png?raw=true)

4.	Then we observed a weak trend between the ratings and the size of the app using a scatter plot.

### Data Visualization

5.	To understand the nuances, we used reg plot.

6.	Using pair-plot we were able to see multiple scatter plots and draw several inferences, e.g. price and rating have a very weak trend, reviews and price being inversely related.

7.	Later we utilized estimator functions along with bar plots as well as box plots to observe the spread of ratings across the different Content Rating Categories. The observation we made was, the ‘Everyone’ category has a lot of apps having very low ratings.

8.	Finally, we created a heat map comparing the ratings across different Reviews and Content Rating buckets.
