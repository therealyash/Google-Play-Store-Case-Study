# Google-Play-Store-Case-Study
This repo contains a case study of the applications on the Google Play Store, where we handle data, compare, the attributes like size, price, ratings of the app and visualize to gain valuable insights.

The tasks performed on the data set are as follows: 

- Data Cleaning
- Data Manipulation
- Data Analysis 
- Data Communication with Information Visualization

The analysis focuses on the breadth and present the data with aesthetics, instead of focusing on a single attribute in depth. This will give us an overall understanding of the applications listend on Play Store.
